This folder will be used to save debug images if debug_mode is set to enabled.
It also contains a colorpicker script which can be used for mask generation.

You can try to make the mask generation more precise by following these steps:

1. Get Image of Death Message Screen where detection failed
2. Use color picker to determine the lower and upper ranges of the new masks
3. implement the new masks in deathcounter.py by adding them to the already existing one

It's also possible that the mask recognizes colors it isnt intended to, in that case you could experiment with removing parts of the mask.
