This folder will be used to save debug images if debug_mode is set to enabled.
It also contains a colorpicker script which can be used for mask generation.

You can try to make the mask generation more precise by following these steps:

1. Get Image of Death Message Screen where detection failed
2. Use color picker to determine the lower and upper ranges of the new masks
3. implement the new masks in deathcounter.py by adding them to the already existing one

The format that colorpicker.py returns is: lower value estimate, value of the selected pixel, upper value estimate

It's also possible that the mask recognizes colors it isnt intended to, in that case you could experiment with removing parts of the mask.

If the script doesnt work for your resolution you can try to change the image crop coordinates in the script
You can use the imageCrop script for that.
The script will export a JSON file which contains all the variables needed. You have to change the crop_file parameter in the config for the changes to activate.
